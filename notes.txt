-- NOTES ON DBMS --


- DAY 1 -


data for specific columns(attributes) of a table have to be of specific types.


project deets:

should have:
a database
an authentication method (login/signup)
a simple website with CRUD operations

will have:
project proposal (also stating what languages and frameworks are to be used)
and project demonstration



basic SQL queries:


CREATE TABLE *name_of_table*
creates a database/table

so a basic create statement would be:

"CREATE TABLE students (

    s_id int,
    name varchar(50),
    cgpa float
);"

so you can see that the variable name is declared first, and THEN the data type.


SELECT
selects data from the table

so a typical select statement would be:

"SELECT * FROM *table_name*;"
here, after SELECT, the asterisk means everything is selected

another example would be, to just show the "names" attribute:
"SELECT name FROM *table_name*;"


INSERT
inserting data into the table

so a basic insert statement would be:

"INSERT INTO *table_name*
VALUES (int (bc id was declared first), "string"(bc string was declared after), float (bc float was entered after)), (*and repeat format here for new values);"

ORDER OF VALUES MUST BE THE SAME AS THE WAY IT WAS DECLARED IN THE CREATE CLAUSE



SYNTAX:

for the keywords, caps are the standard, but instructor does prefer lowercase.
every statement must also end with a semicolon.


DATA TYPES IN SQL:

int -> int
string -> varchar(*length of string*)
float -> float/double

refer to: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_keywords.asp
for more info.

now you can finally start looking up sql commands and stuff.



- DAY 2 - 


to be specific, coding interviews consist mostly of:

 coding (35%), databases (35%), and OOP (30%)
 so databases are def important.



DISTINCT:
shows unique values in a specific column.

SYNTAX:
SELECT DISTINCT col_1
FROM ...



AS (alias):
shows a specific column as a different column name.

SYNTAX:
SELECT col_1 AS new_col_name
FROM...

so, this might be useful, in say, showing the name as "Name". Keep in mind, that quotes are not needed when displaying an alias. however, if the column name
includes a space, then double quotes must be used.




CONCAT:
joins a string with the data on the database to view it nicely.

SYNTAX:
SELECT CONCAT(col_1, " string ", col_2)
FROM ...



a combination of all of these may be:

SELECT CONCAT(name, " belongs to the ", department, " and his/her CGPA is: ", cgpa)
AS "Student Info"
FROM students;




WHERE:
shows instances (rows) based on specific conditions. comes after the FROM clause.

SYNTAX:
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE *condition*;

when trying to match a string in the condition, the comparison must also be with a string in double quotes.
LOGICAL OPERATORS may also be used here (AND/and/&&, OR/or/|, NOT/not/!, and combined conditions too), 
and also COMPARISON OPERATORS (>, <, =, >=, <=, <>, etc.)

-- NOTES ON DBMS --

data for specific columns(attributes) of a table have to be of specific types.


project deets:

should have:
a database
an authentication method (login/signup)
a simple website with CRUD operations

will have:
project proposal (also stating what languages and frameworks are to be used)
and project demonstration



basic SQL queries:


CREATE TABLE *name_of_table*
creates a database/table

so a basic create statement would be:

"CREATE TABLE students (

    s_id int,
    name varchar(50),
    cgpa float
);"

so you can see that the variable name is declared first, and THEN the data type.


SELECT
selects data from the table

so a typical select statement would be:

"SELECT * FROM *table_name*;"
here, after SELECT, the asterisk means everything is selected

another example would be, to just show the "names" attribute:
"SELECT name FROM *table_name*;"


INSERT
inserting data into the table

so a basic insert statement would be:

"INSERT INTO *table_name*
VALUES (int (bc id was declared first), "string"(bc string was declared after), float (bc float was entered after)), (*and repeat format here for new values);"

ORDER OF VALUES MUST BE THE SAME AS THE WAY IT WAS DECLARED IN THE CREATE CLAUSE



SYNTAX:

for the keywords, caps are the standard, but instructor does prefer lowercase.
every statement must also end with a semicolon.


DATA TYPES IN SQL:

int -> int
string -> varchar(*length of string*)
float -> float/double

for more info.

now you can finally start looking up sql commands and shit.
